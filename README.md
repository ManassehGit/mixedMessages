# Mixed Messages

## `Introduction`


This is Mixed messages, a program that basically gives as random message for each run.


- ### `About the Project`
This is part of the portfolio projects to be submitted on Codecademy in the fullstack Engineering track.

- ### `Technologies and Environment`
This is written in JavaScript

- ### `Other Resources`
    - The programming inspirational quotes were taken from [Dhiraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhiraj-ray/) a blogpost on [devglan](https://www.devglan.com/blog/best-developer-quotes)
    - The inspirational quotes were pulled from the post on [KeepInspiring.me](https://www.keepinspiring.me/motivational-quotes/)
    - The emotional quotes were taken from [GoodReads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/emotions)
    
- ### `Further Development`
    - To read the various messages from a text files


## `How to Use the Program`
-The easier way is to generate from the [web page](https://manassehgit.github.io/mixedMessages/)
-You basically call the function and then provide the right parameters to the `quote` function which implements the `getMotivation` function

- Just calling the function without a parameter would return a random uplifting message produced with the combination of phrases
- There are three other options for the parameters: 

  - Programming 
  - Emotional
  - And Inspiring

- Calling the `quote` function with any of the above prints out a random message from that category.
- Example:
    ```
    quote("inspirational")
    ```
    Would print an inspirational message
    - `eg`: We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. - Aristotle
    - ```console.log(quote('inspirational'));```

    ```
    It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. - Aristotle Onassis
    ```
    - Happy Coding to you!
